# zoo
## A program to guide zoo visitors and show what they will see during their visit
### Both the zoo_animals.txt and the welcome-to-the-zoo-bakground.gif files need to be in the same folder as the main zoo.py, or the paths need to be updated
Dependencies are pathlib, datetime, tkinter and calendar. If on mac you should instead use tkinter for mac, tkmacosx, for the buttons as they will otherwise just be white on white independant of the code.
